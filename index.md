Hi! I'm Andrew, a first-year PhD student at [UCSD CSE](https://cse.ucsd.edu/).
I work in the [Programming Systems](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/progsys/) group!

Contact me: `a7cheung@ucsd.edu`

_Are you a UCSD undergrad/master's student interested in research? Let's chat -- I don't bite!_

# Research

**In general, my research motivation is to make it easier to write tricky code[^1].**

Right now, I'm working on [Chompy](https://github.com/ninehusky/chompy), a tool which
uses equality saturation to automatically find conditional rulesets (i.e., rewrite rules
which only apply under certain conditions, such as `if x != 0 then x / x = 1`).

Before UCSD, I was at the University of Washington, where I worked on projects aiming
to make it easier for developers to work with hardware. One of these projects was
[Lakeroad](https://github.com/uwsampl/lakeroad) ([ASPLOS 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16526)),
a hardware compilation tool which uses program synthesis to automatically compile
designs to FPGA primitives.

[^1]: I stole this line from my old advisor, [Zachary Tatlock](https://ztatlock.net).

# Industry

I try to use my research to solve "real-world problems", and I find that industry
is a great place to see what problems are out there! I've been fortunate to work with some amazing
people at some amazing companies.

This past summer, I worked with Sudipta Kundu at [Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/), where I explored
how to use [equality saturation](https://docs.rs/egg/latest/egg/tutorials/_01_background/index.html)
to optimize hardware designs.

Before that, I interned for Jin Yang at [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html),
where I used industry-grade formal verification tools to check the correctness of part of an accelerator.


# Other Stuff

In addition to research, I have a strong passion for teaching. Few things are
as rewarding as making CS education a more inclusive, approachable, and fun experience for everyone.
Before I started my PhD, at UW I was with the TA program for the intro sequence for 5 years!

One of my favorite jobs was being the TA Coordinator for the intro sequence,
where I led over 100 TAs and interviewed, hired, and trained our quarterly cohort of new TAs
alongside the amazing [Chloe Fong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chloe-fong/).

Some highlights:

- [Here's](./assets/photos/thefriends.jpeg) a picture of us from Spring 2023 (I'm in the middle wearing the turtleneck)!

- [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BVsKkF2FUE) a documentary by Northeastern University's Center for Inclusive Computing that highlights the world-class TA program that I'm very lucky to have been a part of.

When I'm not teaching or doing research, I like to
improve my mediocre abilities as an amateur chef, programmer, and artist.
Recently, I've discovered a love for running and lifting heavy things.

I also enjoy playing Dota, which is kind
of like lifting four really heavy things at once.

These days, I'm:
- Reading: _Dune_ by Frank Herbert
- Listening: _Pretty Girls Like Trap Music_ by 2 Chainz
- Playing: _Mass Effect_ and _Starcraft II_
- Watching: _Spy x Family_
- Drawing: lots of Pokemon and the [Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/) curriculum
